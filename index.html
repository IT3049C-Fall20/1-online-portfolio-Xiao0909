          <h2>Personal Background</h2>
          <p>
            My name is Xiao Xiao, and I am from China. I moved to Blue Ash
            about six years ago. I was graduated from Sycamore High School. And now I am a senior and majoring in IT,
            software development track.
            I also have two minors, which are E-Media and Game Art Design. I joined the UC Equestrian team
            when I was a freshman. I have finished two Co-ops with Kingsgate Logistics last year. I would like to try
            the study abroad, but because the
            COVID-19, the program has been stopped. If this program can be reopened before next summer, I think I am
            going to pick this program as my third
            Co-op.
